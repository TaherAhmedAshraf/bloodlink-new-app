# App Icon Implementation for BloodLink App

We've implemented app icons for your BloodLink app using the provided `app-icon.png` file. Here's a summary of what's been done:

## Android Implementation

1. ✅ Created app icons in various resolutions required for Android:
   - mdpi (48x48px)
   - hdpi (72x72px)
   - xhdpi (96x96px)
   - xxhdpi (144x144px)
   - xxxhdpi (192x192px)

2. ✅ Created round app icons for Android in the same resolutions.

3. ✅ Placed the icons in the appropriate directories:
   - `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/`
   - `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/`
   - `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/`
   - `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/`
   - `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/`

4. ✅ Replaced both `ic_launcher.png` and `ic_launcher_round.png` files in each directory.

## iOS Implementation

1. ✅ Created app icons in various sizes required for iOS:
   - 20pt@2x (40x40px)
   - 20pt@3x (60x60px)
   - 29pt@2x (58x58px)
   - 29pt@3x (87x87px)
   - 40pt@2x (80x80px)
   - 40pt@3x (120x120px)
   - 60pt@2x (120x120px)
   - 60pt@3x (180x180px)
   - 1024pt@1x (1024x1024px) for App Store

2. ✅ Created the `AppIcon.appiconset` directory in `ios/bloodlink/Images.xcassets/`

3. ✅ Added the iOS app icons to the `AppIcon.appiconset` directory.

4. ✅ Created a `Contents.json` file in the `AppIcon.appiconset` directory to properly reference all the icons.

## Testing the App Icon

To see the app icon in action:

1. For Android:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

2. For iOS (after completing the splash screen setup):
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

The app icons should now appear on your device's home screen and app drawer.

## Important Notes

1. **Android Resource Naming**: Android requires resource filenames to contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The app icon files (`ic_launcher.png` and `ic_launcher_round.png`) are already using lowercase names, which is why they don't cause any issues.

## Additional iOS Steps

If the app icon doesn't appear correctly in iOS, you may need to open the project in Xcode and verify that the app icon set is correctly selected in the project settings:

1. Open the project in Xcode (`ios/bloodlink.xcodeproj`)
2. Select the project in the navigator
3. Select the "bloodlink" target
4. Go to the "General" tab
5. Make sure "AppIcon" is selected in the "App Icons Source" field

## Customization

If you want to update the app icon in the future:

1. Replace the `app-icon.png` file at the root of your project
2. Run the same image conversion commands used for this implementation to generate the new icons
3. For a proper production app, you might want to use a specialized app icon generator tool for better results
